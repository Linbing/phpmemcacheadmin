=== Server List ===

By default there is only a localhost:11211, you can add your clusters and then your server or instance on same server by typing hostname:port

=You can use phpMemCacheAdmin now and use the default configuration for the rest=

=== Advanced : Commands Configuration ===
Each command executed by phpMemCacheAdmin will use an API, you can choose it here

Some recommendations :

 * Use Server for stats, slabs, items
 * PECL Memcached does not support the slabs and items commands
 * If you're using PECL Memcache in your scripts, don't use PECL Memcache, it is the same for PECL Memcached
 * PECL Memcache can't use delay with flush_all

If you don't use any of the PECL Package, stay with "Server" for each configuration key
